# MyGame
_- a web-based application by Daniel Triviños (2021)_

## Idea Pitch
Whether you’re a high school ballplayer, or a rec league regular, it’d be helpful (or just fun) to have an application that allows you to quickly track your in-game (and update your season-long) stats. _MyGame_ strives to do just that.

I've played countless softball games over the past 10 years, and I’ve tried to keep track of my stats, but there’s never enough time to jot down the results of each at-bat in a notes app or mobile Excel sheet during the game. MyGame lets the user create an account and update their stats throughout the game by simply selecting relevant boxes and logging an at-bat.

### TL;DR

MyGame is a web-based application that allows users to keep track of their sports league performance.

## Simple Description
A **Player** can **Log a Plate Appearance** from their game.

The **Plate Appearance** is added to and updates the **Player's Statistic Sheet**.

The **User** can view their **Statistics** on their **Player Card** page.

**Players** are **Users** of the **MyGame** app, and are assigned passwords which are used as log-on validation.3
